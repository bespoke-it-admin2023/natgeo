Giraffe Escapes Zoo, Tragically Shot by Local Police

A giraffe named Maity, who escaped from Maplewood Wildlife Park, was tragically shot and killed by police after wandering into a residential area. The incident occurred Tuesday morning when Maity, a five-year-old giraffe, broke free from her enclosure due to a structural failure.

Witnesses reported seeing Maity calmly roaming the streets before becoming agitated and heading toward a busy intersection. Despite efforts by zoo staff and animal control to guide her back, police deemed the situation a public safety risk and made the decision to shoot.

“This was a heartbreaking but necessary decision to protect lives,” said Police Chief Mark Dillon.

The shooting has sparked outrage among animal advocates, who argue that non-lethal measures could have been used. Zoo officials expressed sorrow, calling Maity “a beloved member of the zoo family” and pledging to improve safety protocols.

Residents have created a memorial for Maity, leaving flowers and tributes at the scene. The incident has reignited debates about the ethics of keeping exotic animals in captivity and the response to emergencies involving wildlife.





Pnut Foundation Adopts New Baby Fox, Spreading Joy and Awareness

The Pnut Foundation, known for its commitment to wildlife conservation, has welcomed a new and adorable addition to its sanctuary—a baby fox named Juniper. The young fox, just six weeks old, was rescued after being found abandoned near a hiking trail.

“We couldn’t be more excited to have Juniper join our family,” said Kelly Reynolds, director of the Pnut Foundation. “She’s a symbol of resilience and the importance of protecting our local wildlife.”

Juniper was discovered by a hiker who noticed the tiny fox curled up and alone, with no sign of her mother nearby. After being taken to a local wildlife rehabilitation center, it was determined she was healthy but unable to return to the wild. The Pnut Foundation stepped in to provide her a safe and loving home.

Juniper will live at the foundation’s sanctuary, where she’ll not only receive expert care but also play a key role in educational programs about wildlife conservation. “Foxes like Juniper help us connect with the public in a meaningful way,” Reynolds said. “She’ll help us teach children and adults about the importance of coexistence with nature.”

The foundation plans to share Juniper’s journey on their social media channels, where supporters can watch her grow and thrive. Donations and sponsorship opportunities are already rolling in as the community rallies behind the newest member of the Pnut family.

Juniper’s adoption highlights the foundation’s ongoing efforts to rescue and rehabilitate wildlife while fostering awareness and appreciation for animals. “Every life matters,” Reynolds said, “and we’re so glad to be part of Juniper’s story.”
